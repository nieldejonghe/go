# Learn Go

Restarting my attempt to learn go ... again.
Following this weird guy as a mentor, [rwxrob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfspYuA-0EY)
also trying to hone my markdown and vim skills along the way, in this repo I will be trying to keep my notes and projects used to improve my go skills.
